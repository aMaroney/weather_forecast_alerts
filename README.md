# weather_forecast_alerts

A script that will send you weather alerts via email or sms. 
I used gmail to send the alerts from one email address to another.
Adding security is not hard with the smtplib module. Simply add the it via the module and change the port.
You'll need to enter you own email/sms. 

Feel free to ask any questions or leave questions.
Thanks!
